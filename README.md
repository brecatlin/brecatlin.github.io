# SELF ASSESSMENT

My name is Breanna Smith, and since beginning my studies at Southern New Hampshire University in January of 2021, I have grown significantly, both in technical proficiency and personal development. As I reflect on my academic journey through the Computer Science program, I am proud of the diverse set of skills I have acquired, the challenges I have overcome, and the strong foundation I have built for my career moving forward. The development of my ePortfolio serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and capacity to create meaningful solutions that align with user needs and industry standards.

Throughout this program, I’ve had the privilege of engaging with various subjects that have played a pivotal role in shaping my career goals and professional identity. Key areas such as algorithms and data structures, software engineering, database management, security, and user interface design have all contributed to my well-rounded understanding of computer science. These subjects not only provided theoretical knowledge but also offered hands-on experience with real-world applications.

The capstone project further strengthened my skills by providing me with an opportunity to consolidate everything I’ve learned throughout the program. This experience reaffirmed my commitment to delivering high-quality solutions that prioritize user experience. It also allowed me to showcase my ability to handle multiple responsibilities, from managing a project lifecycle to balancing technical requirements with user feedback.

Beyond technical skills, this journey has nurtured my ability to work collaboratively within teams, communicate effectively across diverse audiences, and think critically about the solutions I develop. The program has taught me how to approach problems methodically, consider multiple perspectives, and adapt to the fast-paced, ever-evolving nature of the technology landscape. I’ve gained a deep appreciation for teamwork, as many of the most challenging projects required collaboration and knowledge sharing, enabling me to learn from my peers and contribute to their success as well.

As I prepare to enter the workforce, I feel confident in the skills and experiences I’ve gained through SNHU’s Computer Science program. The combination of technical knowledge, practical experience, and professional development has equipped me to tackle the challenges I will face in the industry. I am eager to contribute to a team environment, apply my problem-solving skills to real-world issues, and continue my growth as a computer science professional. This program has not only shaped my technical expertise but has also instilled in me a deep sense of responsibility to develop solutions that improve user experiences and drive innovation in the field.

#  ARTIFACT FOR EPORTFOLIO

For my ePortfolio, I have selected my Ingredient Scanner App, titled SHOP HEALTHY!, as the primary artifact for this capstone project. This app is not only a reflection of my technical capabilities but also a comprehensive demonstration of my proficiency in three core categories: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management. Each of these elements plays a crucial role in the app’s ability to meet real-world needs while showcasing the culmination of my learning and development throughout the Computer Science program.

The SHOP HEALTHY! app is designed with a clear focus on solving a critical problem for individuals with dietary restrictions or health-conscious consumers. With an increasing number of people seeking to make informed and healthier decisions when purchasing groceries, this app serves as a convenient and reliable tool. The main feature of SHOP HEALTHY! is its ability to scan product barcodes and instantly provide users with a detailed breakdown of the ingredients within the product. This is more than just a simple list; it offers insights into the potential health impacts of each ingredient, helping users avoid harmful additives, allergens, or ingredients that conflict with their dietary restrictions.

The SHOP HEALTHY! app originated as a mockup from a design I created during the CS-319 UI/UX Design course at Southern New Hampshire University. In that course, I applied fundamental principles of user-centered design to ensure that the app’s interface would be intuitive and accessible to a broad audience. Following this initial design, I built the app’s foundation using the principles I learned in CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Development. This involved taking the theoretical design and turning it into a functional mobile application, with careful attention to the app’s architecture, database integration, and performance optimization. These courses laid the groundwork for transforming SHOP HEALTHY! from a conceptual mockup into a working app that demonstrates my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities.



#  CODE REVIEW

The goal of this code review is to take a closer look at the technical and design choices I made while developing my "SHOP HEALTHY!" app. I’ll be walking through key features like the login functionality and the overall user interface, showing how I’ve applied both software engineering and UI/UX design principles along the way.

Throughout this review, I’ll highlight how the project has evolved, including decisions around security, usability, and how I’ve incorporated user feedback to make the app more user-friendly. This process not only demonstrates my technical abilities but also reflects my commitment to creating a smooth, enjoyable user experience while keeping the project focused and manageable.

#  SOFTWARE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING

The "SHOP HEALTHY!" app highlights my skills in both software design and engineering, bridging theory and implementation. Using Android Studio, I developed the app’s layout and core functionality, starting with a secure and responsive login screen. 

A key focus was creating a secure login and sign-up system, with features like input validation, password masking, and an adaptable design for different devices, ensuring both functionality and user-friendliness.

Throughout the project, I balanced aesthetics with usability, focusing on delivering a refined product by limiting the scope to core components like the login screen. The layout, built using Android’s XML structure with LinearLayout and CardView, resulted in a user-friendly and visually consistent interface.

#  ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES

In my CS-499 Capstone project, I focused on enhancing my SHOP HEALTHY! app, originally designed to help health-conscious consumers scan product barcodes and access ingredient information based on dietary preferences.

The key improvement I made was optimizing the ingredient matching algorithm. Initially, the app used a list-based data structure, but I replaced it with a HashMap to allow for faster, constant-time lookups. By using a HashMap<String, String> (with the barcode as the key and ingredient information as the value), the app now retrieves data more efficiently, improving performance, especially with larger datasets.

This enhancement not only speeds up the app but also taught me the importance of selecting the right data structures to optimize user experience and handle future scalability.

#  DATABASES

In my CS-499 Capstone project, I continued work on the SHOP HEALTHY! app, which helps users manage their dietary preferences and make informed grocery shopping decisions by scanning product barcodes. Building on my previous work in CS-319 UI/UX Design and CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Development, I chose to implement SQLite for the app’s database system due to its simplicity and efficiency.

The app uses two databases:

1.) **UserDB**, which manages user accounts, storing usernames, passwords, and dietary preferences (like vegan or gluten-free).

2.) **IngredientDB**, which stores ingredient data associated with product barcodes. This allows the app to retrieve ingredient information quickly when a barcode is scanned.
The system supports key functionality such as user account creation, login using credentials, and ingredient lookups based on scanned barcodes. A major focus was ensuring the app could handle efficient ingredient lookups from the database, which was critical to improving performance.

The transition from the original version to this enhanced one significantly improved the app's functionality, particularly in handling multiple data types and optimizing the database queries for faster and more efficient barcode scanning and ingredient retrieval.
