# SELF ASSESSMENT


My name is Breanna Smith, and I have been a student at Southern New Hampshire University since January of 2021. As I reflect on my journey through the Computer Science program, I am proud of the technical skills and personal growth I have achieved. The development of my ePortfolio not only highlights my technical expertise but also demonstrates my ability to solve complex problems, collaborate with teams, and create solutions that meet user needs. Completing my coursework and building this ePortfolio has solidified my commitment to the field of computer science and has helped shape my professional goals. I am now better equipped to enter the workforce with confidence in my abilities and a clear understanding of the value I bring to a team.

The coursework I completed throughout this program, particularly in areas like algorithms and data structures, software engineering, database management, and security, has played a key role in shaping my skills. Each course challenged me to think critically and provided hands-on experience with real-world applications. For example, my work on the SHOP HEALTHY! app during my CS-319 UI/UX Design and CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Development courses allowed me to demonstrate my ability to develop efficient, scalable software. This project involved integrating multiple databases, optimizing algorithms, and creating a seamless user experience, which are essential skills in the computer science field. The transition from theoretical concepts to practical applications during the capstone project also helped reinforce my commitment to providing high-quality, user-focused solutions.

#  ARTIFACT FOR EPORTFOLIO


For my ePortfolio, I have selected my Ingredient Scanner App, titled SHOP HEALTHY!, as the artifact for this capstone. This app will demonstrate my proficiency in three categories: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. The SHOP HEALTHY! app is designed to assist grocery shoppers with dietary restrictions by providing features that enable users to make informed purchasing decisions. Users can scan product barcodes to get a detailed breakdown of ingredients and their potential health impacts, while also setting personalized dietary preferences. This allows the app to highlight ingredients based on specific health needs or restrictions. 



#  CODE REVIEW

The goal of this code review is to take a closer look at the technical and design choices I made while developing my "SHOP HEALTHY!" app. I’ll be walking through key features like the login functionality and the overall user interface, showing how I’ve applied both software engineering and UI/UX design principles along the way.

Throughout this review, I’ll highlight how the project has evolved, including decisions around security, usability, and how I’ve incorporated user feedback to make the app more user-friendly. This process not only demonstrates my technical abilities but also reflects my commitment to creating a smooth, enjoyable user experience while keeping the project focused and manageable.

#  SOFTWARE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING

The "SHOP HEALTHY!" app highlights my skills in both software design and engineering, bridging theory and implementation. Using Android Studio, I developed the app’s layout and core functionality, starting with a secure and responsive login screen. 

A key focus was creating a secure login and sign-up system, with features like input validation, password masking, and an adaptable design for different devices, ensuring both functionality and user-friendliness.

Throughout the project, I balanced aesthetics with usability, focusing on delivering a refined product by limiting the scope to core components like the login screen. The layout, built using Android’s XML structure with LinearLayout and CardView, resulted in a user-friendly and visually consistent interface.

#  ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES

In my CS-499 Capstone project, I focused on enhancing my SHOP HEALTHY! app, originally designed to help health-conscious consumers scan product barcodes and access ingredient information based on dietary preferences.

The key improvement I made was optimizing the ingredient matching algorithm. Initially, the app used a list-based data structure, but I replaced it with a HashMap to allow for faster, constant-time lookups. By using a HashMap<String, String> (with the barcode as the key and ingredient information as the value), the app now retrieves data more efficiently, improving performance, especially with larger datasets.

This enhancement not only speeds up the app but also taught me the importance of selecting the right data structures to optimize user experience and handle future scalability.

#  DATABASES

In my CS-499 Capstone project, I continued work on the SHOP HEALTHY! app, which helps users manage their dietary preferences and make informed grocery shopping decisions by scanning product barcodes. Building on my previous work in CS-319 UI/UX Design and CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Development, I chose to implement SQLite for the app’s database system due to its simplicity and efficiency.

The app uses two databases:

1.) **UserDB**, which manages user accounts, storing usernames, passwords, and dietary preferences (like vegan or gluten-free).

2.) **IngredientDB**, which stores ingredient data associated with product barcodes. This allows the app to retrieve ingredient information quickly when a barcode is scanned.
The system supports key functionality such as user account creation, login using credentials, and ingredient lookups based on scanned barcodes. A major focus was ensuring the app could handle efficient ingredient lookups from the database, which was critical to improving performance.

The transition from the original version to this enhanced one significantly improved the app's functionality, particularly in handling multiple data types and optimizing the database queries for faster and more efficient barcode scanning and ingredient retrieval.
