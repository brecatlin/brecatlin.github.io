## SELF ASSESSMENT
### SELF ASSESSMENT

My name is Breanna Smith, and I have been a student at Southern New Hampshire University since January of 2021. As I reflect on my journey through the Computer Science program, I am proud of the technical skills and personal growth I have achieved. The development of my ePortfolio not only highlights my technical expertise but also demonstrates my ability to solve complex problems, collaborate with teams, and create solutions that meet user needs. Completing my coursework and building this ePortfolio has solidified my commitment to the field of computer science and has helped shape my professional goals. I am now better equipped to enter the workforce with confidence in my abilities and a clear understanding of the value I bring to a team.

The coursework I completed throughout this program, particularly in areas like algorithms and data structures, software engineering, database management, and security, has played a key role in shaping my skills. Each course challenged me to think critically and provided hands-on experience with real-world applications. For example, my work on the SHOP HEALTHY! app during my CS-319 UI/UX Design and CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Development courses allowed me to demonstrate my ability to develop efficient, scalable software. This project involved integrating multiple databases, optimizing algorithms, and creating a seamless user experience, which are essential skills in the computer science field. The transition from theoretical concepts to practical applications during the capstone project also helped reinforce my commitment to providing high-quality, user-focused solutions.

For my ePortfolio, I have selected my Ingredient Scanner App, titled SHOP HEALTHY!, as the artifact for this capstone. This app will demonstrate my proficiency in three categories: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. The SHOP HEALTHY! app is designed to assist grocery shoppers with dietary restrictions by providing features that enable users to make informed purchasing decisions. Users can scan product barcodes to get a detailed breakdown of ingredients and their potential health impacts, while also setting personalized dietary preferences. This allows the app to highlight ingredients based on specific health needs or restrictions.
